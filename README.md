# About

It connects [Mapy.cz](https://mapy.cz) with a naive TSP algorithm. It allows you to specify places on the map using text descriptions (addresses) and then calculates an optimal route. The addresses and their paths are cached in the browser's local storage, eliminating the need to fetch data each time. Additionally, the setup is saved in the URL, enabling you to edit it later or share it.
